            <p>Stevia, a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of <em>Stevia rebaudiana</em>, has gained popularity as a healthy sugar substitute. Unlike artificial sweeteners, stevia offers sweetness without calories and has no effect on blood sugar levels — making it ideal for diabetics and those managing weight.</p>

            <h3>1. Zero Calories, Same Sweetness</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of stevia is its ability to sweeten foods and beverages without adding calories. This makes it an excellent alternative for anyone looking to reduce sugar intake without sacrificing taste.</p>

            <h3>2. Supports Blood Sugar Control</h3>
            <p>Research suggests that stevia may help stabilize blood sugar levels. Some studies indicate it could improve insulin sensitivity, though more research is still needed.</p>

            <h3>3. May Help Lower Blood Pressure</h3>
            <p>Stevioside, one of the main compounds in stevia, has been shown to potentially lower blood pressure in some people with mild hypertension.</p>

            <h3>4. Safe for Dental Health</h3>
            <p>Unlike sugar, stevia does not contribute to cavities or tooth decay. In fact, it may help reduce bacterial growth in the mouth.</p>

            <p>Stevia has clearly earned its place in the kitchens of health-conscious consumers. However, as with any food ingredient, moderation and product quality matter. Always choose pure stevia extracts without added fillers for the best benefits.</p>
